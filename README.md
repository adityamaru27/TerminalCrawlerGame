# TerminalCrawlerGame

This project implements a simplified rogue-like video game called ChamberCrawler3000. The game is played on a 30x79 board with predefined chamber shapes and passageways. There are five floors linked by staircases, which if cleared successfully by the player, results in him/her winning the game. Through the course of this game we exploited various object oriented techniques and design patterns to ensure our program accommodates change easily and exhibits good coding practices.

Primariliy taken up to solidify understanding of following concepts:

1. Singleton Pattern
2. Decorator Pattern
3. Observer Pattern
4. Factory Method Pattern
5. Aggregation, inheritance and composition
6. UML design
7. Template Pattern

Made along with batchmate Arul Ajmani, of the University of Waterloo.
